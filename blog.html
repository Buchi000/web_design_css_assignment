            <article>
                <p>
                    Browsers are getting better these days. We seem to be in a golden age where there’s a never-ending stream of new features added for the benefit of the users accessing the page, and really great tools for those creating the page. It hasn’t always been the case, though. Earlier versions of today’s browsers had limited features, and we had to consider how to work with — or around— those when designing and developing our sites. Static and adaptive layouts were commonplace, and our sites were designed to pixel perfection. Of course there was a distinct amount of pixel pushing gymnastics involved, though, when implementing our layouts within the constraints the browsers provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to the present, and browser vendors have added in more features to allow us to create flexible and robust designs in a straightforward manner. Take for example, browser zooming. When the user zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending on the user’s preference.

                <p class="title">The browser zoom debate</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        At this point in the design system development process, a debate can ensue. In fact, our team had a very spirited debate about this when our design system was being rebooted — and I noticed that our typography CSS styles were using px-based line-height values as defined in Sketch by our designer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the arguments for using pixels in CSS were: “Browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don’t have to convert our typography to relative units in CSS. Users don’t bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser, our work is done here!” <dusts off hands> Some of the rebuttals for using relative CSS units were: “Yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there’s a difference between how the UI appears when the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser size has been adjusted as well. Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so we need to account for that in our CSS declarations.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so the research began. When I first started looking up recommendations on whether or not using pixels in CSS in general is a good idea, I’d find conflicting opinions on the subject, such as articles like this one describing why you should just use pixels or should stop using pixels in CSS. Articles about responsive sizing in media queries. Even a good article about Accessibility in Resizing Text about the behavior of older browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There wasn’t much mention — or consideration — that users really do dig into the advanced browser settings to change their default font size. Thankfully, I ran across a mention of it in the MDN docs, a really good article by Evan Minto that dives into the user data, and section in Every Layout’s page on rudimentary units.

                            Sixteen pixel (16px) is the default font size Because it is  specified on the css or their is no posibility to overwrite it.   So when the font is set to 200px, the font size is no longer the default HTML font(16px), it is overwritten to 200px.</p>

                <p class="title">What is CSS 3?</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of new features and additions, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.</p>
                        <h3>1. CSS3 Selectors</h3>
                        <p>
                            Selectors are at the heart of CSS. Originally, CSS allowed the matching of elements by type, class, and/or ID. CSS2.1 added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. With CSS3, we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.</p>
                            <h3>2. CSS3 Colors</h3>
                            <p>
                                
                            CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.
                            The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options: HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors
                            </p>
                            <h3>3. Drop Shadows</h3>
                            <p>
                                CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements</p>
                        <h3>4. Radial Gradients</h3>
                        <p>
                            Radial gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. Rather than proceeding along a straight axis, colors blend out from a starting point in all directions.</p>
                        <h3>5.Multiple Background Images</h3>
                            <p>
                            In CSS3, there’s no need to include an element for every background image; it provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements.</p>
                            
                        <h3>6. Rounded Corners: border-radius</h3>
                        <p>
                            The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. To add rounded corners to our box, we simply add
                            border-radius: 25px;
                            The border-radius property is actually a shorthand. For our “a” element, the corners are all the same size and symmetrical. If we had wanted different-sized corners, we could declare up to four unique values
                            border-radius: 5px 10px 15px 20px;</p>
