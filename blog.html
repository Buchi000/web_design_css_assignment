                    Browsers are getting better these days. We seem to be in a golden age where there’s a never-ending stream of new features added for the benefit of the users accessing the page, and really great tools for those creating the page. It hasn’t always been the case, though. Earlier versions of today’s browsers had limited features, and we had to consider how to work with — or around— those when designing and developing our sites. Static and adaptive layouts were commonplace, and our sites were designed to pixel perfection. Of course there was a distinct amount of pixel pushing gymnastics involved, though, when implementing our layouts within the constraints the browsers provided.

                <p>
                    Fast forward to the present, and browser vendors have added in more features to allow us to create flexible and robust designs in a straightforward manner. Take for example, browser zooming. When the user zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending on the user’s preference.

                <p class="title">The browser zoom debate</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        At this point in the design system development process, a debate can ensue. In fact, our team had a very spirited debate about this when our design system was being rebooted — and I noticed that our typography CSS styles were using px-based line-height values as defined in Sketch by our designer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the arguments for using pixels in CSS were: “Browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don’t have to convert our typography to relative units in CSS. Users don’t bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser, our work is done here!” <dusts off hands> Some of the rebuttals for using relative CSS units were: “Yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there’s a difference between how the UI appears when the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser size has been adjusted as well. Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so we need to account for that in our CSS declarations.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so the research began. When I first started looking up recommendations on whether or not using pixels in CSS in general is a good idea, I’d find conflicting opinions on the subject, such as articles like this one describing why you should just use pixels or should stop using pixels in CSS. Articles about responsive sizing in media queries. Even a good article about Accessibility in Resizing Text about the behavior of older browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There wasn’t much mention — or consideration — that users really do dig into the advanced browser settings to change their default font size. Thankfully, I ran across a mention of it in the MDN docs, a really good article by Evan Minto that dives into the user data, and section in Every Layout’s page on rudimentary units.

                        <p>
                            Sixteen pixel (16px) is the default font size Because it is  specified on the css or their is no posibility to overwrite it.   So when the font is set to 200px, the font size is no longer the default HTML font(16px), it is overwritten to 200px.</p>
